# dotfiles
A collection of my dotfiles
setup.py is meant to be used to set up the symlink so that the work we do in dotfiles is used in my home directory.

To get the color prompt function to work start by adding it to your .bashrc file in your dotfiles folder, set up the symlink with the command in setup.py and then run the command bash (at this point it should work)
